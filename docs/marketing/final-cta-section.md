## Final Reassurance

**Still Hesitant?**

Self-hosting isn't for everyone. If you prefer convenience over privacy, MoneyForward/Zaim are excellent cloud options (we're not here to bash competitors). But if you've ever worried about:

- Data breaches exposing your financial history
- Apps shutting down and losing years of data
- Subscription costs eating into your savings
- Third parties analyzing your spending to sell you products

...then SmartMoney is for YOU. Give it 30 minutes. You'll never go back.

## Success Story (Testimonial Placeholder)

> "I migrated from MoneyForward after 5 years. Took 30 minutes to deploy SmartMoney on Hetzner, imported my entire CSV history (12,000 transactions) in 15 seconds. The AI budget blew my mind—it identified spending patterns I never noticed. Now I pay ¥862 per budget instead of ¥500/month. Best decision."
