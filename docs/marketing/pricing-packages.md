## Pricing Transparency

**How Credits Are Calculated:**
```
Cost = (Input Tokens × $0.80/1M + Output Tokens × $4/1M) × 100× markup

Example:
500 input + 800 output tokens
= ($0.0004 + $0.0032) × 100
= $0.36 = 0.36 credits
= ~862 VND at 24,000 VND/$ exchange rate

Why 100× markup?
Industry standard for SaaS (covers infrastructure, support, development).
Still 94% cheaper than MoneyForward Premium annually.
