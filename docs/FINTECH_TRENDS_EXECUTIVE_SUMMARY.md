## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (Q4 2026) | Success Criteria |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DAU (Daily Active Users) | +150% | 30K → 75K |
| Feature Engagement (AI + Gamification) | >40% | >40% of users use weekly |
| Retention (30-day) | >55% | Up from ~40% baseline |
| Household/Family Accounts | >20% of WAU | Feature adoption signal |
| Regional Users (Japan + Vietnam) | >25% of WAU | Market diversification |
| Self-hosted Deployments | >500 | Enterprise interest signal |

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **AI Integration Done Right**
   - Privacy-first: local models by default, cloud optional
   - Personalization: learns user's patterns, improves recommendations
   - Not a toy: accurate categorization, actionable insights

2. **Household Finance Positioning**
   - Cultural resonance: family harmony, transparency
   - Japan: Year-end financial planning, multi-generational wealth
   - Vietnam: OFW remittance tracking, family accounts

3. **Privacy as Marketing**
   - Make it visible: "Your data never leaves your server" (with proof)
   - Open source core: builds trust
   - Compliance: APPI, GDPR, CCPA ready

4. **Regional Localization**
   - Not translation—adaptation
   - Japan: Honor regulatory timeline (FSA open banking)
   - Vietnam: Embrace crypto, SME features, digital wallet integration

---

## Competitive Moat

**What Competitors Can't Easily Copy:**

| Feature | Barrier to Entry |
|---------|-----------------|
| Self-hosted PWA | Technical complexity, hosting support |
| Privacy-first architecture | Requires rearchitect, compliance overhead |
| AI trained on user's own data | Data network effect (more users = better models) |
| Household collaboration | Complex permission/sync system |
| Gamification + personalization | Behavioral psychology expertise |
| Regulatory compliance (APPI, GDPR) | Ongoing legal/technical investment |
| Regional presence (Japan + Vietnam) | Local partnerships, cultural knowledge |

**Lowest Barrier:** Visualizations, Open Banking APIs (Plaid, Moneytree licensing)
**Highest Barrier:** Privacy architecture, household finance UX, AI personalization

---

## Financial Projection (Conservative)

### Revenue Model (Hybrid)
- **Free tier:** Core features (transactions, basic budgets)
- **Premium:** $9.99/mo (AI assistant, advanced features)
- **Family plan:** $14.99/mo (2+ users, household mode)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (teams, SMEs)

### Assumptions (Q4 2026)
- 75K DAU
- 30% Premium conversion (22.5K paying)
- 15% Family plan adoption (11.25K paying)
- ASP (blended): $8/user/mo

### Projected Revenue (Q4 2026)
- **Monthly recurring:** $268K/mo ($3.2M ARR)
- **One-time (self-hosted):** $50-100K/quarter
- **Partner revenue** (bill negotiation split): TBD (10-30% of savings)

**Breakeven:** Q3 2026 (with lean ops: <10 engineers)

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk: API Dependency (Plaid, Moneytree)
- **Mitigation:** Offer CSV import as fallback, cache aggressively, diversify providers
- **Impact:** If Plaid cuts access, users can still manually add transactions

### High Risk: LLM Cost Spiral
- **Mitigation:** Allow user-provided API keys, self-host option, on-device models
- **Impact:** User pays directly to LLM provider, SmartMoney stays lean

### Medium Risk: Regulatory Changes (Privacy)
- **Mitigation:** Monitor APPI/GDPR/CCPA quarterly, maintain compliance buffer
- **Impact:** May need feature adjustments, not core architecture changes

### Medium Risk: Competitor Feature Parity
- **Mitigation:** Differentiate on privacy + self-hosted, not feature list
- **Impact:** Focus on retention (gamification, UX) over acquisition

---

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Phase 1 spec** (AI assistant, health score, shared budgets)
2. **Create detailed implementation plan** per trend (link: `/docs/plans/`)
3. **Secure API partnerships** (Plaid, Moneytree, payment providers)
4. **Begin privacy audit prep** (SOC 2, APPI timeline)
5. **Allocate engineering resources** (4-6 engineers for Phase 1)
